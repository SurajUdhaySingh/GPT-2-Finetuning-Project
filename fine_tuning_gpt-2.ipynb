    "2. For training, CUDA 12.4 will be used. It's compatible with current PyTorch version. Refer to PyTorch docs for a table of compatible CUDA and PyTorch versions. Moreover, is isn't neccassary to import 'torch' and define 'device' variable, i.e, it is optional to manually set CUDA device to the model, and dataset, as Hugging Face Transformers will do it for us.\n",

      "World War I[b] or the First World War (28 July 1914 – 11 November 1918), also known as the Great War, was a global conflict between two coalitions: the Allies (or Entente) and the Central Powers. Fighting took place mainly in Europe and the Middle East, as well as in parts of Africa and the Asia-Pacific, and in Europe was characterised by trench warfare; the widespread use of artillery, machine guns, and chemical weapons (gas); and the introductions of tanks and aircraft. World War I was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, resulting in an estimated 10 million military dead and more than 20 million wounded, plus some 10 million civilian dead from causes including genocide. The movement of large numbers of people was a major factor in the deadly Spanish flu pandemic.\n",
      "\n",
      "The causes of World War I included the rise of Germany and decline of the Ottoman Empire, which disturbed the long-standing balance of power in Europe, as well as economic competition between nations triggered by industrialisation and imperialism. Growing tensions between the great powers and in the Balkans reached a breaking point on 28 June 1914, when a Bosnian Serb named Gavrilo Princip assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne. Austria-Hungary held Serbia responsible, and declared war on 28 July. After Russia mobilised in Serbia's defence, Germany declared war on Russia and France, who had an alliance. The United Kingdom entered after Germany invaded Belgium, whose neutrality it guaranteed, and the Ottomans joined the Central Powers in November. Germany's strategy in 1914 was to quickly defeat France then transfer its forces to the east, but its advance was halted in September, and by the end of the year the Western Front consisted of a continuous line of trenches stretching from the English Channel to Switzerland. The Eastern Front was more dynamic, but neither side gained a decisive advantage, despite costly offensives. Italy, Bulgaria, Romania, Greece and others joined in from 1915 onward. \n",

      "Major battles, including at Verdun, the Somme, and Passchendaele, failed to break the stalemate on the Western Front. In April 1917, the United States joined the Allies after Germany resumed unrestricted submarine warfare against Atlantic shipping. Later that year, the Bolsheviks seized power in Russia in the October Revolution; Soviet Russia signed an armistice with the Central Powers in December, followed by a separate peace in March 1918. That month, Germany launched a spring offensive in the west, which despite initial successes left the German Army exhausted and demoralised. The Allied Hundred Days Offensive beginning in August 1918 caused a collapse of the German front line. By early November, Bulgaria, the Ottoman Empire and Austria-Hungary had each signed armistices with the Allies, leaving Germany isolated. Facing a revolution at home, Kaiser Wilhelm II abdicated on 9 November, and the war ended with the Armistice of 11 November 1918.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Paris Peace Conference of 1919–1920 imposed settlements on the defeated powers, most notably the Treaty of Versailles, by which Germany lost significant territories, was disarmed, and was required to pay large war reparations to the Allies. The dissolution of the Russian, German, Austro-Hungarian, and Ottoman Empires redrew national boundaries and resulted in the creation of new independent states, including Poland, Finland, the Baltic states, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia. The League of Nations was established to maintain world peace, but its failure to manage instability during the interwar period contributed to the outbreak of World War II in 1939.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before World War II, the events of 1914–1918 were generally known as the Great War or simply the World War.[1] In August 1914, the magazine The Independent wrote \"This is the Great War. It names itself\".[2] In October 1914, the Canadian magazine Maclean's similarly wrote, \"Some wars name themselves. This is the Great War.\"[3] Contemporary Europeans also referred to it as \"the war to end war\" and it was also described as \"the war to end all wars\" due to their perception of its unparalleled scale, devastation, and loss of life.[4] The first recorded use of the term First World War was in September 1914 by German biologist and philosopher Ernst Haeckel who stated, \"There is no doubt that the course and character of the feared 'European War' ... will become the first world war in the full sense of the word.\"[5]\n",
      "\n",
      "For much of the 19th century, the major European powers maintained a tenuous balance of power, known as the Concert of Europe.[6] After 1848, this was challenged by Britain's withdrawal into so-called splendid isolation, the decline of the Ottoman Empire, New Imperialism, and the rise of Prussia under Otto von Bismarck. Victory in the 1870–1871 Franco-Prussian War allowed Bismarck to consolidate a German Empire. Post-1871, the primary aim of French policy was to avenge this defeat,[7] but by the early 1890s, this had switched to the expansion of the French colonial empire.[8]\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1873, Bismarck negotiated the League of the Three Emperors, which included Austria-Hungary, Russia, and Germany. After the 1877–1878 Russo-Turkish War, the League was dissolved due to Austrian concerns over the expansion of Russian influence in the Balkans, an area they considered to be of vital strategic interest. Germany and Austria-Hungary then formed the 1879 Dual Alliance, which became the Triple Alliance when Italy joined in 1882.[9] For Bismarck, the purpose of these agreements was to isolate France by ensuring the three empires resolved any disputes between themselves. In 1887, Bismarck set up the Reinsurance Treaty, a secret agreement between Germany and Russia to remain neutral if either were attacked by France or Austria-Hungary.[10]\n",
      "\n",
      "For Bismarck, peace with Russia was the foundation of German foreign policy, but in 1890, he was forced to retire by Wilhelm II. The latter was persuaded not to renew the Reinsurance Treaty by his new Chancellor, Leo von Caprivi.[11] This gave France an opening to agree to the Franco-Russian Alliance in 1894, which was then followed by the 1904 Entente Cordiale with Britain. The Triple Entente was completed by the 1907 Anglo-Russian Convention. While not formal alliances, by settling longstanding colonial disputes in Asia and Africa, British support for France or Russia in any future conflict became a possibility.[12] This was accentuated by British and Russian support for France against Germany during the 1911 Agadir Crisis.[13]\n",
      "\n",
      "German economic and industrial strength continued to expand rapidly post-1871. Backed by Wilhelm II, Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz sought to use this growth to build an Imperial German Navy, that could compete with the British Royal Navy.[14] This policy was based on the work of US naval author Alfred Thayer Mahan, who argued that possession of a blue-water navy was vital for global power projection; Tirpitz had his books translated into German, while Wilhelm made them required reading for his advisors and senior military personnel.[15]\n",

The first revolution involved Russia seizing power from Austria-Hungary; later that year Britain declared victory over French rule.[43] In 1914 after Franco-British support for British expansionism faltered, the Bolsheviks overthrew Tsar Nicholas V in 1917 with Russian backing. However this did not last long; many revolutionaries died before they could be replaced by their own party or political movement.[44][45]:[46]) This led both sides towards civil wars which continued into 1918,[47]. Although there were some successes such at Verdun, these resulted mainly of violent clashes between combatants – usually unarmed protestors who attempted nonviolent protests but became increasingly isolated due either lacklustre leadership skills or poor organisation.[48] During the Second Battle of Ypres, several thousand soldiers took part in demonstrations demanding\n"

    "Right, so now the model has adapted to The Great War by Peter Hart. This generated sequence is slightly less nonsensical than before. Now, why the model struggles to learn history could be due to underfitting. We used the base model, which may not be powerful enough, as it contains 124 million parameters, as compared to XL version, which comes with 1.5 billion parameters. Anyway, our key learnings from this project:\n",
    "Key Learnings\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Model Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "We used GPT-2 Base (124M parameters), which showed limitations in capturing long-term coherence and historical accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generated text exhibited nonsensical phrasing and factual inaccuracies, likely due to the model’s limited parameter size.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model struggled with dates, names, and logical event sequences, leading to unrealistic outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Training Process Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "Training loss steadily decreased, but validation loss was initially NaN due to improper dataset formatting.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model started to produce less chaotic but still flawed generations after multiple iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Larger context windows improved text structure, but did not significantly enhance factual accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Data Preprocessing Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contained empty or malformed samples, which affected training stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Special characters, inconsistent formatting, and line breaks caused tokenization issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some historical terms and dates were not properly learned due to inconsistent representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Areas for Improvement\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Upgrade Model Size\n",
    "\n",
    "Fine-tuning GPT-2 Medium (355M) or Large (774M) can improve coherence and factual consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider switching to LLama 2 or Falcon, which are more efficient and powerful than GPT-2.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Better Training Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "Use more epochs, but carefully monitor for overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement LoRA/QLoRA for parameter-efficient fine-tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Experiment with learning rate scheduling for better convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Enhanced Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "Clean dataset by removing empty samples and malformed text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standardize date and name formats to help with consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Improve tokenization handling for special characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Alternative Sampling Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Experiment with different temperature, top-k, and top-p values for more controlled text generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement beam search instead of sampling for more structured output."
